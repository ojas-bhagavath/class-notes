                Learning Outcomes & Based on core analysis courses and linear algebra, this course builds further on the study  of Banach and Hilbert spaces. The theory and techniques studied in this course support,  in a variety of ways, many advanced courses, in particular in analysis and partial differential  equations, as well as having applications in mathematical physics and other areas\\\hline
