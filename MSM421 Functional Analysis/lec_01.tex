    \begin{itemize}
        \item[]
        \item Vector spaces, the axioms, and examples.
        \item \quad Linear dependence of subsets of a vector spaces (both finite and infinite), basis is a maximal linear independent subset of a vector space.
        \quad\item Every vector space has a basis (Zorn's Lemma), every basis of a vector space has the same cardinality, hence, dimension of a vector space defined as the cardinality of any of its basis is well defined.
    \end{itemize}
