# class-notes
--- 
This repository contains class notes of the classes that I attend written in LaTeX along with BibTex.  
If you just want to access the notes of a course X, you just have to find the only pdf file inside the directory named after the course.  
If you care about compiling things yourself, you should care about the tex files in this repo. You may ignore everything else.
